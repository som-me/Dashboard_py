# Photoshop-Like TIFF Layer Editor

This project is aimed at creating a **Photoshop-like TIFF Layer Editor** using Python. The primary goal is to allow users to import TIFF files, break them into their constituent layers, and edit each layer individually—similar to how Photoshop handles layers. This application is especially designed for a textile company that wants to create a **user-defined real-time layer modifier** for clothing designs.

## Key Features (In Progress)

- **Import TIFF Files**: The application can open a multi-layer TIFF file and extract its layers as individual entities.
- **Layer Panel**: The GUI includes a layer panel similar to Photoshop, showing each layer with:
  - A thumbnail preview.
  - A visibility toggle.
  - The ability to select and display any layer on the canvas.
- **Canvas for Display**: Layers can be displayed on the canvas for viewing and editing.
- **Basic Layer Controls**:
  - Toggle layer visibility on or off.
  - Add new layers to the project.

## Current Progress

1. **Layer Panel**:  
   - The panel shows all the extracted layers from the TIFF file.
   - Each layer can be made visible or hidden using a checkbox.
   - Clicking on a layer’s "Show" button displays it on the canvas.

2. **TIFF File Handling**:  
   - The application successfully loads TIFF files with multiple layers/pages.
   - Each page is treated as an individual layer in the application.

3. **Basic GUI Structure**:
   - A canvas is set up to display the selected layers.
   - Layers are shown in a stacked format, just like Photoshop's layers.

## Future Work

- **Layer Editing**: 
  - Adding functionalities like changing layer colors, applying textures, adjusting blending modes, etc.
  - Allow drag-and-drop layer reordering.
- **Layer Opacity & Blending**: 
  - Sliders and dropdowns to control layer opacity and blending.
- **Layer Export**:
  - Allow users to save the edited layers back into a multi-layer TIFF file or export in other formats.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI.
- **Pillow**: For handling image processing and TIFF files.
- **OpenCV**: (optional, in future stages) For more advanced image processing.

To install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pillow opencv-python
```

## Installation & Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tiff-layer-editor.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python dashboard.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Import TIFF**: 
   - Click on the "Load TIFF" button to select a TIFF file from your system.
   - The layers will appear in the right-side layer panel.

2. **Edit Layers**:
   - Toggle the visibility of each layer by using the checkboxes in the layer panel.
   - Click the "Show" button to display the selected layer on the canvas.

3. **Add New Layers**:
   - You can add a new blank layer by clicking the "Add Layer" button.
